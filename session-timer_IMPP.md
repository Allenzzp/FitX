# Session Timer Implementation Progress

## Feature Overview
Add session duration timer to FitX workout tracking app with iOS-style roller picker (10-70 min) and overtime tracking.

## Database Schema Changes
```javascript
// trainingSession collection - new fields:
{
  sessionLen: Number,        // Target duration in SECONDS (e.g., 3600 for 60:00)
  remainTime: Number,        // Remaining time in SECONDS  
  timerExpired: Boolean,     // Default false, true when timer hits 0
  extraTime: Number,         // Overtime in SECONDS (only when timerExpired = true)
}
```

### 5. Timer Expiry Handling
- [x] Modal popup when timer reaches 00:00
