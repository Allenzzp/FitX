# Bug-2 UI Redesign Implementation Progress

## Problem Summary
- **Issue**: Mobile keyboard hides "Jumps remaining" during manual rep entry
- **Root Cause**: Vertical stacking layout uses too much vertical space
- **Solution**: Redesign to side-by-side layout with circular timer component

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Create circular timer component with progress ring
- [x] Create `CircularTimer.tsx` component
- [x] Implement SVG-based circular progress ring
- [x] Add color coding: 90%+ green, 10% orange, 5% red
- [x] Add click-to-pause functionality
- [x] Style with triangle pause indicator
- [ ] Test timer accuracy and visual updates

### ✅ Step 2: Redesign main layout to side-by-side structure  
- [x] Modify WorkoutTracker.tsx active session layout
- [x] Place "Jumps remaining" on left side
- [x] Place circular timer on right side
- [x] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test keyboard interaction (main goal)

### ✅ Step 3: Implement click-to-pause functionality
- [x] Connect circular timer click to pause/resume logic
- [x] Update existing pause/resume functions
- [x] Handle state transitions properly
- [ ] Test pause/resume behavior

### ✅ Step 4: Add conditional button logic
- [x] Hide "Pause Training" button during active sessions
- [x] Show "End Training" and "Resume Training" when paused
- [x] Update button positioning and styling
- [ ] Test all session state transitions

### ⏸️ Step 5: Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test on various mobile screen sizes
- [ ] Verify keyboard doesn't hide jumps remaining
- [ ] Test circular timer touch interactions
- [ ] Verify all functionalities work on mobile
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## Current Status: Working on Step 1
- **Next Action**: Create CircularTimer component with SVG progress ring

## Notes
- Keep existing timer logic intact (only UI changes)
- Maintain all existing pause/resume business logic
- Focus on mobile UX improvement as primary goal
